This notice was last updated on July 13, 2022.\n\nThis policy only applies to personal data processed by or on behalf of the UserZoom Group (as described further below), who operate the IntelliZoom platform.\n\n#### About us and how to contact us\nThe operators of the IntelliZoom platform are the UserZoom Group which consists of UserZoom Technologies, Inc, together with a number of subsidiaries (including User Zoom Inc, UserZoom Limited, UserZoom GmbH and UserZoom Technologies, Inc Sucursal en España.

We may also share your data amongst the UserZoom group companies (as outlined above). We will have in place an agreement with each of these processors which will restrict how they are able to process your personal information and require them to keep it secure. If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will also ensure that any such transfer of personal data is governed by an adequacy decision or an alternative valid mechanism for international data transfers, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses. We will never sell your personal data.\n\nWe may also share your personal information: (a) as required by law or legal process; (b) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or other requests; (c) to investigate suspected violations of any terms or policies applicable to our products or the services provided by us or our third party providers or affiliates; (d) where we reasonably conclude that it is necessary for defending, exercising or establishing our legal rights; (e) to investigate alleged or actual fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct; (f) in connection with a prospective sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or similar transaction; and (g) to other third parties with your express consent. \n\n#### Third-party websites \nThe website (or the platform) may contain links to other websites or Internet resources.

We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your information. We suggest that you read the privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.\n\n#### Security\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. We have adopted appropriate technical and organisational measures and follow industry best practices in order to protect any personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\n#### How long do we keep your information for? \nWe may only retain your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy and for as long as we have a legal or business requirement to do so.

You will need to contact such Study Creators directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving future emails from a Study Creator).
